# W3schools-clone-
This project is a clone of the W3Schools homepage, created solely using HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to learn and demonstrate HTML and CSS skills by replicating the design and layout of the original W3Schools homepage.

## Getting Started
To view the cloned W3Schools homepage, simply open the w3schols.html file in a web browser. There is no need for any additional setup or installation.

## Structure and Files
The project consists of the following files and directories:
W3schools.html: The main HTML file that represents the cloned W3Schools homepage.
W3schools.css: The CSS file that contains all the styles and layout information for the cloned homepage.
images/: A directory containing the video walk through of the cloned homepage.
README.md: The readme file you are currently reading.
How to Use
Once you open the index.html file in a web browser, you will see the cloned W3Schools homepage. The layout, design, and content are replicated to resemble the original homepage as closely as possible.

However, please note that this is a static clone, and the interactive functionality, such as search and tutorials, are not implemented.

Feel free to explore the code in the index.html and style.css files to see how the homepage is structured and styled using HTML and CSS.
